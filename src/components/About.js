            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p><strong>I'm a human-centered designer specializing in crafting design systems and future-proof solutions, seamlessly bridging the gap between design and code.</strong></p>
            <p>Employing a holistic, user-centered approach, I leverage teamwork, design thinking, and agile workflows to achieve client goals. I excel in creative environments and pride myself on being a natural problem solver and team collaborator.</p>
            <p>I'm highly proficient in Figma, but am no stranger to other prototyping software or the Adobe Creative Suite. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, SASS, Node.js, p5.js, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, C#, Git, Dart, Flutter, Wordpress, and Webflow.</p> 
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy getting creative any way I can, gaming, playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, and making things â€“ like this website, crafted with React.js and SASS.</p>
